# Locker Bag Packing Checklist

What is a locker bag?

Every year, there are a handful of lockers available to festival attendees. They usually sell out by Noon on the first day of the festival, but if you can snag one, they're incredibly useful for you and your friends.

More info on the lockers is available [here](http://www.outsidelandslockers.com/u03.htm), but the gist of it is that you can pay $30-40 (in cash or PayPal -- no credit cards) for a centrally-located locker that you can use for all three days of the festival.

If you're lucky enough to grab one, here's what I suggest that you load it up with:

- [ ] Collapsible water bottle(s) or Nalgenes (useful to keep filled up in lockers to avoid long lines at filling stations between shows)
- [ ] $60 in emergency cash (useful if your phone dies and you need to grab a taxi)
- [ ] Sunscreen - spray and rub on
- [ ] A hat
- [ ] An long sleeve t-shirt (takes up less space than sweater)
- [ ] An extra jacket for friends who forget (or for new friends)!
- [ ] Sunglasses
- [ ] Phone charger and charging cables (both iPhone and Android)
- [ ] Plastic bags (to keep things organized during festival entry security inspection)
